/**
 * MODEL LAYER EXPLANATION
 * 
 * In this project, Supabase (PostgreSQL) acts as our Data Model layer. 
 * Since Supabase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), the table definitions, 
 * relationships, and security policies are managed directly in the database.
 * 
 * For a full reference of the data structures, please see:
 * /Backend/database_schema.sql

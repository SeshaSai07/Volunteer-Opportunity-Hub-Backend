Deployment Guide: GitHub & Render
Your backend is now fully feature-complete and tested! This guide will help you move it from your local machine to the cloud.

🛠️ Pre-Deployment Checklist
1. Check 
package.json
Render uses npm start to run your app in production. Ensure your scripts section looks like this:

json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
2. Environment Variables
Your 
.env
 file contains sensitive keys. Do not push .env to GitHub. On Render, you will manually add these keys in the "Environment" dashboard:

PORT: 10000 (Render's default)
SUPABASE_URL: Your project URL
SUPABASE_KEY: Your project Anon/Public Key
📦 Step 1: Push to GitHub
Initialize Git:
bash
git init
Add all files:
bash
git add .
Commit:
bash
git commit -m "Final backend implementation complete"
Push to your Repo:
bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
🚀 Step 2: Deploy to Render
Create New Service: On dashboard.render.com, click New + -> Web Service.
Connect GitHub: Connect your repository.
Configuration:
Runtime: Node
Build Command: npm install (if running from Backend folder: cd Backend && npm install)
Start Command: node server.js (if running from Backend folder: cd Backend && node server.js)
Environment Variables:
Click "Advanced" -> "Add Environment Variable".
Add SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY.
✅ Is the project functional?
Yes. Based on our testing of all 12 modules, your project is structurally sound and production-ready.

What you have built:

Security: Role-Based Access (Admin/Org/Vol) and Secure JWT Auth.
Scalability: Pagination and Rate Limiting.
Intelligence: Personalized Notifications.
Management: Full Admin Dashboard support.
Social: Real-time messaging logic and group coordination.
One Final Recommendation: Run your Walkthrough one last time from Phase 1 to Phase 5. If everything returns a "200 OK" or "201 Created", you are ready for the world! 🌍🌟
